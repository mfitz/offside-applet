        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Place the mouse pointer over a player. Blue players are
                attacking the goal at the top of the screen, reds defending.
                Hold down the mouse button. Drag the player into any position on the pitch you fancy.
                Release the mouse button to drop the player in his current
                location. Repeat with as many players as you like.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the 'Offside?' button. The red line represents the 'offside threshold'
                i.e. the point beyond which attacking players must not stray if
                they are to remain onside.
            </li>
            <li>
                The applet will either inform you of the (most) offside player,
                or describe the play as being onside.
            </li>
            <li>
                You also have the facility to draw arbitray shapes over the scene,
                a la Andy Gray on Sky Sports. To do this, click and drag the mouse
                without selecting a player to move. You are the pundit!
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are technically minded (or just curious, in all senses
                of the word...) you can
